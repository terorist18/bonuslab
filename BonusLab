Emergency credit
We do not recommend payday loans or other forms of high-cost credit.

They have high interest and charges and cause a lot of trouble.

It is better to look at credit unions and government-run schemes. These can give quick, emergency loans to people.

Credit unions
Credit unions are local, member-owned alternatives to banks.

They have three main aims:

To offer loans with low interest rates
To help members save
To help give members financial advice and help
You need to be a member of a credit union to get a loan from them. Some will ask you to build up savings first.

Grants
Turn2Us is a charity we work with. They help people get grants and access support services.

Contact them to see how they can help you.

Trust funds
We also work with a number of companies who provide ‘trust funds’.

These are for people who cannot afford insolvency services or energy bills.

Help from your local council
Your council has a local welfare assistance scheme.

These schemes are to help people on low incomes.

Each council runs their own scheme with different rules.

Some schemes include:

Small cash loans or grants
Food vouchers
Free used furniture
